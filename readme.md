# EMOS- Rust Microkernel

EMOS is a hobby OS, made in Rust. Underneath the EMOS is its microkernel that runs it. This is something where I can learn to make a OS using Rust and making a micro kernel which is a bit different then a monolithic kernel ( where many modern popular OSes uses a monolithic kernel).

## To-Do list

* [ ] Build the Microkernel
* [ ] Shell
* [ ] some other stuff idk yet never thought I'll get this far

## How to run it

Pre-requisites:

* Linux ( best for developing Operating Systems in general)
* Rust nightly

Running:

`$cargo run`
